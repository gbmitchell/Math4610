## Development of Math 4610

This course was developed by [Joe Koebbe](http://www.math.usu.edu/~koebbe) at [Utah State University](http://www.usu.edu)
in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.math.usu.edu/). The course is
intended for students in the [College of Science](https://www.usu.edu/science), the College of Engineering, and any other
students who have completed a basic course in linear algebra (e.g, Math 2270 Linear Algebra) AND ordinary differential
equations (e.g, Math 2280 Ordinary Differential Equations). Students who have completed the combined course Math 2250
are also well qualified to be in this course. Primarily, the course presents computational methods for the approximate solution 
of a number of mathematical problems. The amount of analysis needed is minimal (e.g, Taylor series and knowledge of results from 
Linear Algebra). The goal is to introduce students into the world of computer coding and simulation. Later courses (e.g,
Math 5610 and Math 6610) treat analysis of the methods at a more advanced level.
