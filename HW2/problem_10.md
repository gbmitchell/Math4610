# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics
Homework 2, problem 10.

A web search for non-linear root finding methods led me to the following:

This is an application problem involving planitary movement about the sun. Part of the problem involves finding roots
to equations. This source explains fixet point iteration, bisection, and secant methods used in root finding.

This is an artical about the need and importance of non-linear root finding methods. This artical covers the theory of
Newton-Raphson method to finding roots.

This is a project done that includes root finding of non-linear systems. Newtons, Finite-Difference, and Broyden's
methods are used in this project.
