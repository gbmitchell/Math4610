# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics
**Homework 1, Solution 9.**

A web search for an application that is influenced by machine precision led me to the following:

[https://www.desmos.com/calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)

This is the online graphing application I used for making my plots in problem 10. This application uses numerical
methods to calculate properties of diferent functions as input by the user. Since the caluclations are done by a
machine, the results are influenced by the precision of the machine making the calculations nessasary to draw the
plots.
